  Outline:
Instamap is a social app that will let users know who else is in the same event with them. Our features is based on GoogleMaps, GooglePlaces, and Instagram API's, we will have to layer different API's that use each other.  The Library we will use are D3.js, React, and leaflet. We are consider another technology to do webscraping for extracting information from websites using Python, we are not sure if this is needed or how to deploy it.
Aaron, is working on the sketch of the final product and breakdown of tasks.

Direction for Instructors:

Library - we can make this app look good and work with using only CSS or D3.js, and to use Leaflet for mobile-friendly  interactive maps.

API's - should give us: 1) media images 2) location search
Using both of these we can compare the two things to make sure they are the same image.

Instagram API
The ability to search through and pull images from specific hashtags is one of the most basic functions of the Instagram API or from tags created by other users. With this function, we can create a gallery of images or have the photostream automatically update as new pictures are added. We need to get access today.
